For this project, I decided to work out where the best place would be for a new coffee shop to open in London, taking into consideration the number of coffee shops already in the area and the ratings they have. If there are lots of coffee shops with mainly good reviews, that implies that the loyal customer base would be unlikely to switch to a new business so the best area would have few coffee shops and/or lower ratings on the coffee shops already there.
